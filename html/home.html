        <h2> Advice</h2>
        <p> Don't take anything here for serious! </p>
        <h2> What you can do </h2>
        <p> Please contribute to this webpage by submitting your own idea about Atlantis. Let your fantasy play! </p>
            <ul>
                <li> How has the world been? </li>
                <li> Where do the Atlantians come from?  </li>
                <li> What have they achieved?  </li>
                <li> How have they perished? </li>
            </ul>
        <p> You can prepare your own webpage and just give the url or submit the source code. You can stick to the hosts webpage '/assets/css/style.css' or create your own style. Your website will be included in the yellow frame, please consider, that you do not have all viewport width available. It might be better to work only with percentages for big sizes. Surprisingly it worked suddenly with viewport as well or was it surprise before it did not take available width as 100vw. Scrolling up and down should be activated within the story html. </p>
        <p> It is adviced to put your own navigation bar to the left but it is not mandatory. </p>
        <p> New stories will not be added automatically to ensure common rules of politeness are not broken.</p>
